<p>PentesterLab Essential Badge is a challenge available on PentesterLab, an online platform for learning and practicing web application security testing.

  The Essential Badge challenge is designed to teach learners the fundamental concepts and techniques of web application security testing. Participants are presented with a vulnerable web application and must identify and exploit a series of vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and file     inclusion vulnerabilities.

  The challenge is divided into several modules, each focusing on a different aspect of web application security testing. As participants progress through the modules, they learn about different vulnerabilities and attack techniques, as well as best practices for identifying and mitigating these vulnerabilities.

  The Essential Badge challenge is suitable for anyone interested in learning more about web application security, including beginners and experienced professionals. It provides a hands-on, practical approach to learning, and is designed to help participants develop the skills they need to identify and mitigate web       application vulnerabilities.
