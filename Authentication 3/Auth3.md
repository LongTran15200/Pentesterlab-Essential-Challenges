# Objective

This example shows the consequence of different methods of string comparison.

When you create a user, the application will check programmatically that the user does not exist by comparing the username provided with the existing users.

When you log in, the application will check that your username and password are correct, and then it will save your username in your session.

Finally, every time you access the application, the application will retrieve your user's details based on the username provided in the session.

The trick here comes from the fact that the comparison when you create a user is done programmatically (i.e.: in Ruby) but when the user's details get retrieved, the comparison is done by the database. By default, MySQL (with the type `VARCHAR`) will perform a case-insensitive comparison: "admin" and "Admin" are the same value.

Using this information, you should be able to create a user that will be identified as `admin`.

This is pretty easy and straightforward. The answer already given from objective. Its **Case-insensitive**

Due to Case-Insensitive, you can register as admin as long there is Case-Insensitive.

For example **---"Admin", "aDmin", "ADMin"**, etc. All of these admin will successfully execute and will login as admin.
