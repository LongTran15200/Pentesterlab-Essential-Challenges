# Objective

<p>This example is similar to the previous example.

As soon as you receive a cookie from an application, it is always good to see what it looks like.

Try to crack it using a password cracker or try to just Google it. From there you should be able to generate a valid cookie for the user `admin`.</p>

**If you get the same session ID many times when logging in: there is a problem! If you log in from a clean browser, you should never get the same cookies twice.**

![screenshot Authentication 2]()


<p>Similar to the previous authentication 1, this time the password is in md5 hash. you need to reverse into string.

  For example--- **user1 = 24c9e15e52afc47c225b757e7bee1f9d**

In order to login as admin, you need to convert string into md5 and paste into the value to replace your created user1.

  So--- **admin = 21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3**</p>
