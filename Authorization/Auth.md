# Objective

In this example, you can log in with the following user: `user1` with the password `pentesterlab`.

Once you are logged in, you can start accessing information and see the pattern used: `/infos/1`, `/infos/2`.

If you keep incrementing the number in the URL, you can access information from other users.

![SS Auth Home](:/d25c2092a2bf4a0daf012f1eab5d1fdf)

As you logged in, there will be 2 information you can access.Â 

![SS Auth Path](:/9daf2a79f84c44ae8194ec116371ffa1)

The Confidential user1 will content path /infos/1

![SS Auth Path Secret](:/c3cbadbe094c4e4584459d5f297f96ab)

The Confidential user1 (2) will content path /infos/2

The main secret of this objective is to find the hidden path

![SS Auth Key!](:/fe49a4df56974ca982063897ac0cdc4c)

If you keep incrementing the number infos/#, you will eventually find the hidden folder.
