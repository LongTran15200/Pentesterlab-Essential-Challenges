<h1>Objective</h1>


 <p>
  
In this exercise, you can log in as `user1`.
  
Your goal is to get logged in as  `admin`.To do so, you need to carefully look at the response sent back by the server.

You can see that when you log in as `user1`, you get a cookie named `user1`.

From the cookie, you can easily modify a value (using a proxy or a browser's extension) to get logged in as `admin`.</p>
