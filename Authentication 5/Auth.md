# Objective

In this challenge, the problem is completely different from the previous ones.

Here the issue comes from the way the user gets redirected back to the login page.

The developer forgot to stop the execution after redirecting users to the login page. By carefully inspecting the responses sent back by the server, you should be able to get the key.

What this mean is before the website direct to login page, there is a key inside the script.

This is the URL when we first opened.Â

to direct before the login page, we need to delete login.php, and use burpsuite to intersect it.

What represented here is the GET request before login.php and after. What you want to look is the orange highlighted request. From there, open the response from the server we've requested and you will see a key as you scrolls down.
