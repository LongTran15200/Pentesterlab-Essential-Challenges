# Objective

In this example, you can access the information using a method similar to the one seen previously.

You cannot just directly access the information, however you can see that you are now able to edit information.

You can use this feature to access information from other users just by incrementing the number in the URL.

![SS Authorization Home](:/fc099f76429b4b279be999b7896e23e0)

As you can see, this objective is similar to the previous challenge. but you won't able to access the information by incrementing it.

If you change the **infos/1** to **infos/3**, you will be logged out immediately. 

![SS Authorization Path](:/d08f3bc693634075b1019fb9ef82a569)

When you clicked on the first info, you will able to edit the current info.

![SS Authorization Path](:/a73f473e25b64158b90d0d8ee116216b)

Your point here is not to edit the info, but to find the hidden folder. Again you saw the **infos/1/edit** in the parameter. 

==**Try to change that to infos/3/edit**==

![SS Authorization Keys!](:/b78e7225bc7a4fc2b9a679960755be68)
