# Objective

To remediate the previous issue, the developer decided to use a case-sensitive comparison during user creation.

This check can also be bypassed based on the way MySQL performs string comparison: MySQL ignores trailing spaces (i.e.: ```pentesterlab and ``pentesterlab[space] are equals). Using the same method as above, you should be able to pretend to be logged in as the user `admin.` `` ```

***A good way to prevent this issue is to tell the database that the username is a PRIMARY KEY. This method is, for example, used in Tomcat documentation to use a SQL backend as a Real***

Similar to the previous challenge (Authentication 3) this challenge is about ignore trailing spaces. In order to login as ***admin***, you must register as admin with spacing.

Since the application ignored spacing and doesn't treat space as a character, it will think its admin instead of Admin[space]. this will successfully let us login as admin.
